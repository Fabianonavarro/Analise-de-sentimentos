I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in New York City last week. The staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming.
The view from the Eiffel Tower was breathtaking, but the hotel in Paris was disappointing. The room was tiny and dirty.
I had a great experience at the Marriott in Tokyo. The location was perfect, just a short walk to the train station.
I booked a stay at the Grand Hyatt in Los Angeles for a business trip. The conference rooms were excellent, but the food was subpar.
Stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Miami, the beach was right outside, and I had a wonderful time enjoying the sun.
The hotel I stayed at in London was awful, I will never go back to that Holiday Inn. The staff was rude and unhelpful.
My family had a fantastic stay at Disneyland Hotel in California. The kids loved the theme park, and we were treated like royalty.
The room at the Four Seasons in Dubai was luxurious, and the service was top-notch. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
